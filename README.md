# Crime-Analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze crime data to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to the type of crimes, their locations, victim demographics, and case closure rates. The analysis helps in understanding which crimes are most common, where they occur, and how effectively they are being resolved.
